                        <h2>Biblical Context</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Throughout the entirety of the New Testament, we are taught about the importance of Priesthood keys. Starting with Jesus himself walking for days to be baptized by his cousin John who held the Priesthood keys over baptism, all the way to several prophecies in revelations. But what are Priesthood keys? And why are they important? </p>
                        <p class= "lead"></pclass>Christ gives invaluable insight on this matter to Peter in Matthew 16:19 
                            "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead"> Instead of reading “whatsoever” put the word “ordinance” (an ordinance is a sacred, formal act or ceremony performed by the authority of the priesthood). In this light we can understand that with this power, our ordinances are valid both here on earth and in Gods eyes.  Without verse 18 it’s very easy to still not understand the importance of this discovery “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” Peter was later given the priesthood (see John 15:16) and that thus was the foundation of the Church, so the Priesthood keys aren’t physical as they are sometimes depicted, but they are the power and authority of God given to those He chooses.    </p>

                        <p class="lead">Rather than just loving God and following his word how you best feel, understanding that God chooses who receives his Priesthood keys creates a problem. There is or at least there was a Church with His authority. If that’s true where is that Church now? When multiple Churches or people claim that power how can I know who is right?</p>

                        <p class="lead">These questions and the countless others that are crossing your mind have crossed mine. Fortunately, many other people have also had these questions and as taught in James 1:5, God answers our question. One such person by the name of Joseph Smith was almost oblivious to the idea of priesthood power but had a deep desire for the welfare of his soul. After studying much and visiting several churches Joseph heard this scripture and knew God would tell him which church was right.</p>
                        <p class="lead"> While describing what happened during this prayer Joseph said,” I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!”
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Throughout the following years Joseph Smith was prepared to restore lost truths. One day while translating an ancient record he asked another question that changed the world forever. The text contained teachings about Jesus Christ giving the Priesthood authority to preform baptisms. Joseph and his scribe Oliver Cowdery wondered if baptisms over the centuries had been performed by this authority. They determined to pray and ask God, Oliver recounts “The voice of the Redeemer spake peace to us and an angel came down clothed with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked for message.” Joseph and Oliver testified that they knelt before the angel who then “laid his hands upon us” and said, “Upon you my fellow servants in the name of Messiah I confer the priesthood of Aaron.” The Priesthood that had been lost due to corruption and unrighteousness was restored once again.

                        <p class="lead">As with everything pertaining to religion, conclusions upon facts are subjective rather than objective. The facts presented today can neither prove nor disprove that Priesthood keys are real and have the effect that the scriptures claim they have. They can’t prove that God and Jesus appeared to Joseph Smith and that he later received the Priesthood keys from angles. They can, however, tell us what Joseph claimed happened and it's up to us to determine if that is real or not. There is only one way to know for sure, it’s the same way I know and the same way Joseph knew. Study and prayer.</p>
